# PROJECT TITLE
Durham College: Data Tools Analytics- Assignment 5
## DESCRIPTION
The aim of the project is to create a function in Python to calculate the distribution of channel type from the top 1000 records of the 4000 records in a youtube dataset.
Moreover, we will then load the top 1000 records of the original 4000 into a separate CSV file called ‘export.csv’ and 
hence, this project will also highlight how to export new csv files using Python codes.
